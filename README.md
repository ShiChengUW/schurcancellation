# schurcancellation
"schurcancellation" is a Mathematica program for canculating refined topological string partition functions. It could cancel Schur functions by Cauchy identities, and represents the partition functiosn in terms of Nekrasov functions and MacMahon functions. This can be done in a few seconds even for complicated toric diagrams. In order to extract BPS invariants, this code could sum up the contributions of Young diagrams to higher orders. One can see examples for explicit calculations.
