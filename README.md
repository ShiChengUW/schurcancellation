# schurcancellation
"schurcancellation" is a Mathematica program designed for refined topological vertex. It could cancel Schur functions by Cauchy identities, and represents the refined closed topological string partition functions in terms of Nekrasov functions and MacMahon functions. This canculation can be finished in a few seconds even for very complicated toric diagrams. In order to extract BPS invariants, this code can sum up the contributions of Young diagrams to higher orders. One can see examples for explicit calculations.
